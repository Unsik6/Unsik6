&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, I'm unsik6. I was an undergraduate researcher at Algorithm lab of Inha Univ. I am studying algorithms and computational geometry algorithms of theoretical computer science. I often work on tutoring basic datastructures and algorithms to some undergraduate student. I studied developing video games, but not now.
